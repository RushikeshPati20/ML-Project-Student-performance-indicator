# Student Performance Dataset

## Introduction
This dataset contains information about student performance in exams along with various demographic and background attributes. The dataset includes the following attributes:

- Gender: Sex of students (Male/Female)
- Race/Ethnicity: Ethnicity of students (Group A, B, C, D, E)
- Parental Level of Education: Parents' final education (Bachelor's Degree, Some College, Master's Degree, Associate's Degree, High School)
- Lunch: Whether the student has standard or free/reduced lunch
- Test Preparation Course: Whether the student completed a test preparation course before the exam
- Math Score
- Reading Score
- Writing Score

## Data Source
The data was collected from [source link or description of data source].

## Data Preprocessing
Before using the dataset, some preprocessing steps may be necessary, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

** 
## Data Checks

### Missing Values
Check for missing values in the dataset.

### Duplicates
Check for duplicate rows in the dataset.

### Data Type
Ensure correct data types for each column in the dataset.

### Number of Unique Values
Check the number of unique values for each column in the dat


## Usage
This dataset can be used for various analyses and machine learning tasks, including but not limited to:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationships between different variables.
- Predictive modeling to predict student performance based on demographic and background attributes.
- Identifying factors influencing student performance and providing insights for educational interventions.
